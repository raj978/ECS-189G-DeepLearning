   - CIFAR (colored object images)

2. ✅ **CNN Model Implementation**: A complete CNN model has been implemented with customizable:
   - Convolutional layers (variable number and parameters)
   - Pooling layers
   - Fully connected layers
   - Various optimization algorithms
   - Different loss functions

3. ✅ **Training and Evaluation**: The implementation includes:

- Flexible CNN architecture with configurable layers and parameters
- Support for different input dimensions and channel counts
- Adaptable to all three datasets
- Various optimizer options (Adam, SGD, RMSprop)
- Multiple loss function options

### 2. Dataset Loading (`Dataset_Loader.py`)
- Support for MNIST, ORL, and CIFAR datasets
- Proper preprocessing for each dataset type
- Normalization and transformation

### 3. Evaluation (`Evaluate_CNN.py`)
- Comprehensive metrics calculation
- Learning curve visualization
- Confusion matrix plotting
- Results storage in structured format

### 4. Execution Scripts
- Basic script for standard model evaluation
- Advanced script for comprehensive experiments
- Single-model utility script with command-line arguments

## Experimental Approach

The implementation follows a systematic approach to experimentation:

1. Establish baseline models for each dataset
2. Vary one architectural aspect at a time:
   - Network depth
   - Kernel size
   - Optimization method
   - Regularization approach

This methodology ensures that the impact of each architectural decision can be isolated and analyzed.

## Design Choices

1. **Modular Design**: Separation of concerns between data loading, model architecture, and evaluation
2. **Configuration-Driven**: Parameters are configurable without code changes
3. **Reproducibility**: Fixed random seeds for consistent results
4. **Results Management**: Structured storage of models, metrics, and visualizations
